## A few scripts for doing things in the computer game Kerbal Space Program (KSP)

### What is KSP? 
It's a computer game where you build rockets and fly into space... sometimes.

While having proper orbital (newtonian) mechanics, it is otherwise a light-hearted world where you play as small ailiens on a fictional planet. 

### What is kOS?
It's a mod where you write programs to run on a virtual machine on the craft.

Allthough sometimes it must interface with the computer game, it generally tries to provide as full simulation as possible.
The language is called kerboscript and is a proprietary language perhaps best described as purposfully a bit quirky but made to be fun and easy.
